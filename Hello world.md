mercedes is a good car

Absolutely agree with it

1. Account github.com was created.
2. Create local repository.
3. Make local and remoted repos friends. On the first creating repo Github helps you with startings.
4. Send (push) your local repo to remoted (on Github), on this way, maybe u will have to authorize on remoted repo.
5. Make some changes on another PC.
6. Download an actual status from remoted repo.
